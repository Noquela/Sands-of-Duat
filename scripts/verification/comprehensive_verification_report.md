   - **Evidence:** Clear explanatory comment: "Removed duplicate enhanced drawing to fix double rendering bug on ultrawide displays"

2. **Base Component Delegation**
   - **Location:** Line 1027 comment
   - **Change:** Cards and end turn button now rendered exclusively by base component system
   - **Evidence:** Comment states "Cards and end turn button are now rendered by base components"

3. **Atmospheric Preservation**
   - **Location:** Line 1031
   - **Status:** âœ… PRESERVED
   - **Evidence:** `_draw_atmospheric_elements(surface)` call maintained

### âœ… Base Component System Verification

**File:** `sands_duat/ui/base.py`

1. **Component Rendering Loop:** âœ… VERIFIED
   - Lines 221-223 and 235-237 handle component rendering
   - Proper visibility checking: `if component.visible:`
   - Automatic rendering of all components in `self.components` list

2. **UI Architecture:** âœ… VERIFIED
   - `UIScreen.render()` method handles all component rendering
   - Components managed through `self.components: List[UIComponent]`
   - No duplicate rendering paths in base system

## Functional Testing Results

### âœ… Game Launch Verification

**Test Execution:** Successfully launched game in ultrawide mode
- **Resolution:** 3440x1440 (ultrawide target resolution)
- **Status:** âœ… SUCCESSFUL

| Standard displays | âœ… EXPECTED PASS | No changes to standard resolution handling |

### âœ… UI Component Testing

1. **Cards Rendering**
   - **Previous:** Duplicate cards displayed on ultrawide
   - **Current:** Single instance rendered by base components
   - **Status:** âœ… FIXED

2. **End Turn Button**
   - **Previous:** Duplicate button displayed on ultrawide  
   - **Current:** Single instance rendered by base components
   - **Status:** âœ… FIXED

3. **Atmospheric Elements**
   - **Egyptian battlefield elements:** âœ… PRESERVED
   - **Obelisks, columns, torches:** âœ… MAINTAINED
   - **Visual atmosphere:** âœ… INTACT

## Performance Impact Analysis

### âœ… Rendering Efficiency

   - Base component system functioning correctly
   - UI manager transitions working properly
   - Screen management operational

2. **Audio System:** âœ… FUNCTIONAL
   - Audio Manager initialized successfully
   - Sound effects properly loaded
   - Clean audio system shutdown

3. **Game Engine:** âœ… STABLE
   - Engine initialization successful
   - Content loading working
   - HourGlass timing system functional

## Technical Implementation Verification

### âœ… Architecture Compliance

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Base UI system handles core rendering âœ…
   - Combat screen focuses on game-specific logic âœ…
   - No rendering conflicts between systems âœ…

2. **Code Quality**
   - Clear explanatory comments added âœ…
   - Maintained code readability âœ…
   - No introduction of technical debt âœ…

3. **Maintainability**
   - Fix is simple and well-documented âœ…
   - Easy to understand and verify âœ…
   - Low risk of future regressions âœ…

## Security and Stability

### âœ… No Security Concerns
