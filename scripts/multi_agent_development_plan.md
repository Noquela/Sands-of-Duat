## Development Workflow Integration

### Primary Workflow Pattern
```
User Request → Multi-Agent Analysis → Q&A Coordination → Claude Implementation
```

### Detailed Process Flow

#### 1. Request Routing
- **All development requests** route through multi-agent system first
- **Request classification** determines agent task type:
  - `ui_enhancement`: UI-focused tasks (Egyptian theming, user experience)
  - `code_development`: Technical implementation tasks
  - `analysis`: Quality assessment and optimization
  - `general`: Mixed or complex multi-domain tasks

#### 2. Simultaneous Agent Analysis
- **Parallel execution** of specialized agent analyses
- **Domain expertise** applied to each request:
  - UI Specialist: Visual design, Egyptian authenticity, accessibility
  - Code Specialist: Technical feasibility, architecture, performance
  - MCP Analyst: Quality metrics, integration risks, optimization opportunities

#### 3. Q&A Coordination
- **Synthesis** of diverse agent perspectives
- **Conflict resolution** between different recommendations
- **Priority ranking** of implementation steps
- **Risk assessment** and mitigation strategies
- **Final unified plan** with actionable steps

#### 4. Implementation Execution
- **Claude implements** the coordinated plan
- **Real-time feedback** to Q&A coordinator during implementation
- **Quality gates** at each major milestone
- **MCP analysis** integration throughout implementation
