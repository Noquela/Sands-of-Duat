# CLAUDE.md - Sands of Duat Project Instructions

## Project Overview
This is the **Sands of Duat** game development project - an Egyptian underworld themed deck-building roguelike with Hades-quality art.

## Primary Reference Document
**ALWAYS refer to the SANDS_OF_DUAT_MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md file** for all development decisions, technical specifications, and implementation details.

## Core Instructions

### 1. Implementation Approach
- Follow the 20-week sprint plan outlined in the master implementation plan
- Use the sub-agent system for specialized development tasks
- Maintain 60fps @ 3440x1440 ultrawide performance targets
- Implement Hour-Glass Initiative system with sub-millisecond precision

### 2. Quality Standards
- All art must meet Hades-quality standards
- Egyptian mythology must be culturally authentic and respectful
- Code coverage must exceed 85%
- Performance regressions are not acceptable

### 3. Development Workflow
- Break tasks into 2-4 hour micro-tasks as specified in the sprint plan
- Use specialized agents (architect, gameplay-designer, ui-ux-specialist, etc.) for appropriate tasks
- Validate all implementations against the master plan requirements
- Test continuously with automated test suites

### 4. Technical Architecture
- Use Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture
- Implement Ba-Ka soul mechanics for strategic depth
- Maintain authentic Egyptian mythology integration
- Use AI art generation pipeline for consistent visual quality

### 5. Content Requirements
- 100+ Egyptian mythology cards with authentic lore
- 12-hour underworld journey progression system
- Distinct AI personalities for Egyptian gods
- Complete deck-building and combat systems

## Key Principles
1. **Authenticity First**: All Egyptian elements must be culturally accurate
2. **Performance Critical**: 60fps is non-negotiable
3. **Quality Over Speed**: Hades-level art quality is required
4. **Plan Adherence**: Follow the master implementation plan exactly
5. **Test Everything**: Comprehensive testing at every step
