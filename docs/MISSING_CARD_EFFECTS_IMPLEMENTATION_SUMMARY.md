# Missing Card Effects Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the missing card effects identified in the previous analysis to complete the Sands of Duat card system. All priority missing effects have been implemented and tested.

## Implemented Effects

### 1. PERMANENT_SAND_INCREASE ✅
**Used by:** `pyramid_power` (1 sand) and `duat_master` (2 sand)

**Implementation:**
- Added `PERMANENT_SAND_INCREASE` to `EffectType` enum in `cards.py`
- Implemented effect resolution in `combat_manager.py` using `HourGlass.increase_max_sand()`
- Permanently increases the player's maximum sand capacity
- Includes safety checks to prevent exceeding absolute maximum (8 sand)
- Provides appropriate logging and visual effects

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Pyramid Power correctly increases max sand by 1 (6 → 7)
- ✅ Duat Master correctly increases max sand by 2 (6 → 8)
- ✅ Visual effects and logging working properly

### 2. DRAW_CARDS (Complete Implementation) ✅
**Used by:** 6 Egyptian cards including `whisper_of_thoth`, `desert_meditation`, `horus_divine_sight`

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced existing `DRAW_CARDS` effect to actually draw cards from deck into hand
- Implemented proper deck management with reshuffling of discard pile
- Added hand size limits (10 cards maximum)
- Includes proper logging and visual effects
- Handles edge cases (empty deck, full hand)

**Test Results:**
- ✅ All 6 Egyptian cards with DRAW_CARDS effects working correctly
- ✅ Deck reshuffling when deck is empty
- ✅ Hand size limits respected
- ✅ Proper card tracking (deck size decreases, hand size increases)

### 3. BLESSING ✅
**Used by:** `canopic_jar_ritual` and `temple_offering` cards

**Implementation:**
- Added `BLESSING` to `EffectType` enum in `cards.py`
- Implemented Egyptian-themed persistent buff system
- Blessings stored in nested structure within entity buffs
- Duration tracking with proper turn-by-turn countdown
- Support for different blessing types (`divine_favor`, `preservation`)
- Integrated with combat state display

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Blessing effects properly applied and tracked
- ✅ Duration countdown working correctly
- ✅ Multiple blessing types supported
- ✅ Integration with combat state system

### 4. CHANNEL_DIVINITY ✅
**Used by:** `duat_master` legendary card

**Implementation:**
- Added `CHANNEL_DIVINITY` to `EffectType` enum in `cards.py`
- Implemented unique legendary effect for sand mastery
- Grants `divine_sand_mastery` permanent combat buff
- Provides `sand_cost_reduction` of 1 for all cards
- Updated card cost calculation to respect cost reduction
- Thematic Egyptian implementation

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Duat Master correctly applies both effects
- ✅ Sand cost reduction working in `play_card` method
- ✅ 3-cost card playable with 2 sand when reduction active
- ✅ Divine sand mastery buff applied permanently

## Updated Systems

### Card System (`cards.py`)

- Comprehensive logging and visual effects for all new effects

### Egyptian Card Loader (`egyptian_card_loader.py`)
- Updated effect type mapping to support new effects
- Proper mapping of YAML effect types to new enum values
- Fixed target field mapping issue

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
Created two test files to verify implementations:

1. **`test_missing_card_effects.py`** - Unit tests for each effect type
2. **`test_specific_cards.py`** - Integration tests with actual Egyptian cards

### Test Results Summary
- ✅ All unit tests passing
- ✅ All integration tests passing  
- ✅ Specific cards working with new effects
- ✅ No regression in existing card functionality
- ✅ Proper error handling and edge case coverage

## Cards Successfully Enhanced
