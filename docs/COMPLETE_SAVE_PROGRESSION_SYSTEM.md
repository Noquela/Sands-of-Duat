## 🔄 Event System

The progression manager uses an event-driven architecture with the following events:

- `level_up`: Player gained a level
- `achievement_earned`: New achievement unlocked
- `chamber_completed`: Chamber finished
- `battle_won/battle_lost`: Combat results
- `card_discovered`: New card obtained
- `save_completed`: Save operation finished
- `backup_created`: Backup operation completed

## 📋 Integration Checklist

To integrate this system into your game:

1. **Initialize Systems**
   ```python
   from sands_duat.core.game_progression_manager import init_progression_manager
   progression_manager = init_progression_manager()
   ```

2. **Handle Game Events**
   - Call `record_battle_result()` after each battle
   - Call `complete_chamber()` when chambers are finished
   - Call `save_game()` at appropriate intervals

3. **UI Integration**
   - Add progression UI screens to your game
   - Display achievement notifications
   - Show progression statistics

4. **Error Handling**
   - Handle save/load failures gracefully
   - Implement backup recovery for corrupted saves
   - Validate user input for security

## 🧪 Testing

Run the complete example to test all systems:
```bash
python sands_duat/examples/complete_progression_example.py
```

This demonstrates:
- New game creation
- Battle progression
- Chamber completion
- Achievement unlocking
- Save/load cycles
- Backup operations
- Security validation

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- Auto-save runs every 5 minutes by default
- Backup maintenance every 30 minutes
- Background services use daemon threads
- Data change tracking minimizes unnecessary saves
- Compressed storage for backups

## 🔧 Configuration

### Save System Settings
```python
# Auto-save frequency (seconds)
save_system.auto_save_interval = 300

# Security level
security_manager = init_security_manager(SecurityLevel.HIGH)

# Backup limits
backup_manager.max_auto_backups = 10
backup_manager.max_manual_backups = 20
```

### XP and Level Settings
```python
# XP per level (with scaling)
reward_system.base_xp_per_level = 1000
reward_system.xp_scaling_factor = 1.15

# Win streak multipliers
reward_system.streak_multipliers = {5: 1.2, 10: 1.5, 15: 2.0, 25: 3.0}
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Save Compatibility**: The system includes migration support for future updates
2. **Security**: High security level requires password for encryption
3. **Backups**: Automatic cleanup prevents disk space issues
4. **Performance**: Background services are lightweight and non-blocking
5. **Recovery**: Multiple recovery options prevent data loss

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

Potential future additions:
- Cloud save synchronization
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Player comparison features
- Achievement sharing
- Seasonal events and rewards
- Advanced deck analysis tools

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the example file for proper usage
2. Review logs for error details
3. Verify save file integrity
4. Use backup recovery if needed

This system provides a solid foundation for player progression in Sands of Duat, ensuring data safety, engaging progression mechanics, and a robust technical implementation.
