**Transform Sands of Duat into Hades-level polish with 4 focused sprints. Current issues: UI elements lost in ultrawide 3440x1440, static gameplay, inconsistent visual style, poor UX feedback.**

## SPRINT 1: Ultrawide UI/UX Clarity (Week 1)
- Create responsive layout system for 3440x1440 with proportional scaling
- Increase font sizes: titles 48â†’72px, buttons 50â†’70px height
- Redesign combat HUD: minimal top/bottom health bars, larger action buttons bottom-right
- Add proper spacing between cards (min 20px) to prevent overlap
- Implement content margins: 15% lateral spacing, centered layout
- Fix hierarchy: make important elements 40% larger on ultrawide

## SPRINT 2: 4K Art Pipeline & Visual Identity (Week 1)
- Set up local Stable Diffusion XL pipeline for consistent Egyptian art
- Generate 4K assets: backgrounds (4096x2048), card frames, character portraits (1024x1024)  
- Create animated card borders for rarities (common/rare/epic/legendary)
- Standardized prompts: "ancient egyptian art, papyrus texture, hieroglyphs, golden accents, cinematic lighting, 4k masterpiece"
- Replace all placeholder assets with AI-generated consistent style
- Implement dynamic asset loading system

## SPRINT 3: Animation & Visual Effects (Week 1)  
- Card play animations: scale hover (1.0â†’1.1), bezier movement, rotation during drag
- Combat effects by type: attack (lightning particles), heal (green spiral), buff (golden aura)
- Menu transitions: 0.5s fade+slide, button hover scale+glow
- Background subtle parallax movement
- Screen shake for impacts, floating damage numbers
- Particle system for sand, fire, light effects

## SPRINT 4: Player Feedback & UX Flow (Week 1)
- Visual state indicators: "YOUR TURN" large text, playable cards green glow
- Audio feedback: Egyptian-themed SFX for actions, subtle error sounds  
- Invalid action feedback: red outline+shake, tooltip explanation
- Mana/health bars with smooth animations
- Progressive disclosure for new players
- Win condition progress visualization

**Technical Requirements:**
- Maintain 60fps on 3440x1440
- Create ultrawide_layout.py, card_animator.py, particle_system.py, egyptian_theme.py
- Generate all assets in assets/generated_4k/ structure
- Implement responsive scaling throughout codebase
- Add animation queuing system for smooth effects

**End Goal:** Transform static, unclear UI into polished, animated, intuitive Egyptian card game matching Hades visual quality and UX standards.

Execute all 4 sprints in sequence, creating all necessary files and systems.
